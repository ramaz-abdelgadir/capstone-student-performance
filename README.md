## Dataset Content
* Describe your dataset. Choose a dataset of reasonable size to avoid exceeding the repository's maximum size of 100Gb.


## Business Requirements
* The purpose of this project is to analyse the academic behaviour and performance of students to help educators identify the factors that most influence final grades.
By exploring relationships between study habits, attendance, participation, and achievement, the project provides data-driven insights that can guide teaching strategies, student support, and academic planning.

Primary Business Objectives

1. Understand academic drivers: Determine how self-study hours, attendance, and class participation influence student grades.

2. Predict academic outcomes: Build statistical and machine-learning models to estimate student performance and identify at-risk learners.

3. Support data-informed decisions: Present actionable insights in an interactive Power BI dashboard for teachers and administrators.

4. Encourage student engagement: Use insights to design interventions that promote better attendance, active participation, and consistent study habits.

## Hypothesis and how to validate?
1. Students with higher study time will achieve higher average scores.

2. Students who participate more in class have higher education levels tend to perform better.

3. There is a significant difference in average scores between students with and without good attendance level.

## Validation approach:

* Method: Correlation and group comparison.

* Python: Compute correlation between weekly_self_study and grade, and visualise with scatterplot or boxplot.

* Power BI: Create a line or bar chart with weekly_self_study on the axis and average grade as values.

* Method: Correlation and grouped mean comparison (ANOVA if participation is categorical).

* Python: Compare mean grade across different participation levels.

* Power BI: Use a clustered column chart with class_participation as axis and average grade as values.

* Method: Correlation and independent samples T-test (if you categorise attendance).

* Python: Categorise attendance (e.g., ‚â•90 % = ‚ÄúGood‚Äù, <90 % = ‚ÄúLow‚Äù) and test grade differences.

* Power BI: Compare average grades by attendance level using a column chart.

## Project Plan
* Outline the high-level steps taken for the analysis.
* How was the data managed throughout the collection, processing, analysis and interpretation steps?
* Why did you choose the research methodologies you used?

## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualisations
* Each business requirement is linked to specific data visualisations that enable clear, evidence-based insights.
The following table and explanations describe how and why each chart or visual directly supports the project‚Äôs analytical goals.

## Analysis techniques used
1. The analysis followed a logical progression, ensuring clarity and reproducibility:

2. Data Cleaning & Preparation ‚Üí Ensured dataset accuracy and completeness (handled missing values, encoded variables).

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) ‚Üí Used visuals and summary statistics to discover patterns and correlations.

3. Hypothesis Testing ‚Üí Used statistical methods (T-test, ANOVA) to confirm or reject assumptions.

4. Predictive Modelling ‚Üí Applied regression and decision tree models to quantify and predict performance outcomes.

5. Segmentation (Clustering) ‚Üí Grouped students by similar learning patterns for actionable insights.

6. Visual Communication ‚Üí Presented findings through Power BI for stakeholder interpretation.

Justification:
This structured approach mirrors the CRISP-DM model and allows each phase to build logically on the previous one ‚Äî from understanding the problem to delivering interpretable, evidence-based results.

## Reflection:
Generative AI acted as a collaborative assistant ‚Äî helping to speed up development and improve code quality ‚Äî but human oversight remained essential to ensure context accuracy, ethical integrity, and data validity.

## Ethical considerations
Ethical, legal, and social responsibility are essential components of all data analytics work ‚Äî particularly when handling information about students.
This section outlines how privacy, bias, and fairness were considered throughout the project and how potential issues were addressed.

## Dashboard Design
It‚Äôs tailored to your Student Performance dataset (student_id, weekly_self_study, attendance, class_participation, grade) and describes the visuals, layout, interactivity, and communication rationale for both technical and non-technical audiences.

### üìä Dashboard Design

The Power BI dashboard was designed to communicate insights about student performance clearly and interactively, enabling both technical users (data analysts, educators) and non-technical stakeholders (teachers, administrators) to explore key factors that influence academic outcomes.

The design follows the information hierarchy principle ‚Äî starting from high-level KPIs on the Overview page and progressively allowing deeper analytical exploration through filters, drill-downs, and visual interactions.

### Interactivity and Widgets

Slicers / Filters: Enable users to dynamically view performance based on attendance or participation levels.

Buttons: Navigate between pages and reset filters.

Tooltips: Provide contextual explanations of metrics when hovering over visuals.

Cards: Summarise key KPIs such as Average Grade or Correlation Score for instant insight.

Custom Themes: Use consistent colour schemes (blue for study, green for attendance, orange for participation) to aid comprehension.

## Unfixed Bugs
Throughout the project, several minor issues and limitations were identified.
Where possible, workarounds were implemented ‚Äî however, some remain unfixed due to framework constraints or deliberate prioritisation of higher-value tasks.
* my notebook was using the Agg backend. I had to switch to the  inlinr backend by the following code:
 #### %matplotlib inline
 #### import matpoltlib
 #### print("backend:", matplotlib.get_backend)

  * when trying to push any updates the notebook is trying to find the data file but can't locate it because the working directory is not set correctly. To fix this Co Pilot helped by first checking the current state and then updating the path detection logic.
